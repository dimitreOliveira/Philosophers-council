# Philosophers council

### Seek council from some of the most relevant philosophers of all time.

This project is a chatbot powered by Google's [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/) open-source model. Here you will find a Gradio app with multiple chatbots that impersonate famous philosophers. You can seek guidance or talk with them and get responses based on different philosophy schools.

Feel free to extend this app, tweak the existing bots or add your own.
